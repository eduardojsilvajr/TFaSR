This repository is a refactoring of the code implemented in the article "Terrain feature-aware deep learning network for digital elevation model superresolution."(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2022.04.028)  

the code was reorganized based on PyTorch Lightning and torchgeo.

You still need to dowload the Unet files from the original article.
